Transfer Wordle Streak to a New Phone

After using https://sethmlarson.dev/blog/wordle-stats to transfer the overall stats,
use this utility to find the previous streak start and import it to the new phone.
Sadly this is a much less pleasant process than importing the other stats.

# To use (still testing)
## On the old device
1. Create a new bookmark (it doesn't really matter where the bookmark points).
2. Open show-streak-start.txt and copy its text
3. Edit the bookmark to replace its location with the text
4. Go to Wordle and open the bookmark. Write down the entire value it shows you.

## On the new device
1. Create a new bookmark (it doesn't really matter where the bookmark points).
2. Open import-streak.txt and copy its text.
3. Edit the bookmark to replace its location with the text. Replace TIMESTAMP with the number you wrote down. It's in the middle.
4. Import your other stats using https://sethmlarson.dev/blog/wordle-stats
5. Go to Wordle and open the bookmark.
